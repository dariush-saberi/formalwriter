Children are no longer economic assets, but are in fact very financially costly, and many women may decide they cannot afford to have children (Schoen et al, 1997).

Aspirations for certain standards of living may also influence the decision as some will feel that the cost of children would not fit in with the lifestyle they wish to have (Andorka, 1978).</td>
